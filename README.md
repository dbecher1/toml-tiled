# toml-tiled

A super simple plugin for the Tiled map editor to export maps as .toml files. May not expand upon this at all, it's really simple and barebones atm, I'm just learning Rust so I figured it'd be nice to have Tiled maps play nice with the markup language that Rust also plays very nice with.
